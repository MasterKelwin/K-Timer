## About

Im a front-end developer studying React and Java, i made this app to learn more SCSS, CSS Modules, responsive, function components, typescript and hooks. 

And here we have an app who captures user inputs and make a object, this object goes to other components to make different things around all the application. 

### Functionalities

1- Render components passing props around all the application without using global scope.
2- An interface made for the main object, the task.
3- useState for save an array of tasks and render in DOM (keys used with ID).
4- useEffect to watch the state of selected, if changed other value gonna be input on cronometer.
5- Responsive on all devices, even after deploy.
6- Leaving few responsabilities as possible in the components, except in the main app because I choose to not use global scope.
7- Some simples animations for make the app more cool.
8- A list who shows all the complete tasks.


### Dependencies

1-Typescript
2-UUIDv4
